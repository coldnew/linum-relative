(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))
(require 'linum)

;;;; Faces
(defface linum-relative-current-face
  '((t :inherit linum :foreground "#CAE682" :background "#444444" :weight bold))
  "Face for displaying current line."
  :group 'linum)

;;;; Local vars
(defvar linum-relative-last-pos 0
  "Store last position.")

(defvar linum-relative-current-symbol "0"
  "The symbol you want to show on the current line, by default it is 0.
   You can use any string like \"->\". ")

(defvar linum-relative-plusp-offset 0
  "Offset to use for positive relative line numbers.")

(defvar linum-relative-format "%3s"
  "Format for each line. Good for adding spaces/paddings like so: \" %3s \"")

;;;; Advices
(defadvice linum-update (before relative-linum-update activate)
  "This advice get the last position of linum."
  (setq linum-relative-last-pos (line-number-at-pos)))

;;;; Functions
(defun linum-relative (line-number)
