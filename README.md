linum-relative lets you display relative line numbers for current buffer.


### Installation


If you have `melpa` and `emacs24` installed, simply type:

    M-x package-install linum-relative

And add the following to your .emacs

    (require 'linum-relative)

### Setup & Tips


The non-interactive function *linum-on* (which should already be built into recent GNU Emacs distributions), turns on side-bar line numbering:

    (linum-on)

and alternatively, by using command:

    M-x linum-relative-mode

Relative line numbering should already be enabled by default (by installing this package), following *linum-on* or enabling *linum-mode*. One can also use the *linum-relative-toggle* interactive function to switch between relative and non-relative line numbering:

    M-x linum-relative-toggle


### Backends


By default, linum-relative use *linum-mode* as backend, since linum-mode is based on emacs-lisp, you may have performance issue on large file.

Since linum-relative 0.6, if you also use emacs version 26.1 or above, you can setup `linum-relative-backend` to make linum-relative-mode use `display-line-number-mode` as backend, which is implement in C so the performance is really nice.

However some linum-relative's customize function may not work propely.

Here's how to use `display-line-number-mode` as backend:

```elisp
     ;; Use `display-line-number-mode` as linum-mode's backend for smooth performance
	(setq linum-relative-backend 'display-line-numbers-mode)
```

### Dual Mode


To show both absolute line numbers and relative numbers side-by-side you can toggle `linum-relative-dual-display` in your customizations or add the following line to your `.emacs` file:

This setting is OFF by default.

```elisp
  (setq linum-relative-dual-display t) ;; default nil
```



### Customization Documentation

#### `linum-relative-current-symbol`

The symbol you want to show on the current line, by default it is 0.
   You can use any string like "->". If this variable is empty string,
linum-releative will show the real line number at current line.

This won't take effect if you choose `display-line-numbers-mode` backend.

#### `linum-relative-plusp-offset`

Offset to use for positive relative line numbers.

This won't take effect if you choose `display-line-numbers-mode` backend.

#### `linum-relative-format`

Format for each line. Good for adding spaces/paddings like so: " %3s "

This won't take effect if you choose `display-line-numbers-mode` backend.

#### `linum-relative-lighter`

Lighter of linum-relative-mode

#### `linum-relative-backend`

The default backend for `linum-relative`, by default we use
`linum-mode` (slow), you can switch to `display-line-numbers-mode` if
you has emacs-version greater than 26.0.50.
