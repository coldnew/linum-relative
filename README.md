linum-relative.el – display relative line number in emacs.
==========================================================

![Screenshot](https://github.com/coldnew/linum-relative/raw/master/screenshot/screenshot1.jpg)

linum-relative lets you display relative line numbers for current buffer.


Installation
------------

If you have `melpa` and `emacs24` installed, simply type:

	M-x package-install linum-relative

In your .emacs

	(require 'linum-relative)

Setup & Tips
------------
The non-interactive function *linum-on* (which should already be built into recent GNU Emacs distributions), turns on line numbering:

```lisp
(linum-on) 
```
        
Relative line numbering should already be enabled by default (by this package) following *linum-on*. Otherwise one can use the **lineum-relative-toggle** interactive function to switch between relative and non-relative line numbering:
```lisp     
M-x linum-relative-toggle
```
